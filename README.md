# Nathan's `Homelab`

**Hey, there!**

**I’m Nathan, and I’m passionate about creating tech content for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.**

This Repository **Homelab** contains all my homelab documentation files. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

I created these resources to be freely used for your specific use cases. If you're looking for detailed, in-depth tutorials on certain tools or technologies, please refer to the specific application vendor's documentation for more comprehensive information.

The content I've provided is based solely on open-source tools and projects that I discovered and thought might be beneficial to others for which I've created easy to install scripts and setup where at the time were operational.

## Contribution

As this is my personal Homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions. But feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own documentation.
